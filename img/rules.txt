Dream Come True?

Rules:

Brad's addiction has been reignited as he is starving after nearly running out of food on the ship\
He has sniffed out what appears to be a fresh danish! He has a choice, die fighting for food or die of starvation
At the base they have prepared Brad for the worst. He has a gun which he has never used before and a jetpack!


Holding W uses the Jetpack and propells him up in space for a short period

Holding D moves Brad RIGHT

Holding A moves Brad LEFT

Pressing SPACEBAR shoots Brad's pistol
